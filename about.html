    <p>
      Hello.<br />I am a recent graduate of the Northcoders bootcamp and I am
      really excited to show you how far I've come in such a short period of
      time.<br />
      I started my journey as a software developer like most people did.<br />
      Fleeing France before they closed down the borders due to a global
      pandemic.<br />It was at this point that I decided I would make the most
      of this situation.<br />That brings us to today. A full 3 months of
      Northcoders Bootcamp with 2 months self study leading up to it.<br />All
      to get this "magnificent" website and the chance to show off my work.<br />I
      really hope you all enjoy.
    </p>
