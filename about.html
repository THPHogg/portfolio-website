    <p class="about-me">
      Hello.<br /><br />I am a recent graduate of the Northcoders bootcamp and I
      am really excited to show you how far I've come in such a short period of
      time.<br /><br />
      I started my journey as a software developer like most people did.<br />
      Fleeing France before they closed down the borders due to a global
      pandemic.<br /><br />It was at this point that I decided I would make the
      most of this situation.<br /><br />That brings us to today.<br /><br />
      A full three months of Northcoders Bootcamp with an additional two months
      self study leading up to it.<br /><br />Five months hard work in order to
      get the chance to be able to show off my humble website and body of
      work.<br /><br />I really hope you all enjoy.
    </p>
